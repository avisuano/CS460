# Homework Three

The requirements for this assignment can be found [here](http://www.wou.edu/~morses/classes/cs46x/assignments/HW3.html).

The repository of code can be found [here](https://github.com/avisuano/CS460/tree/master/HW3).


## Getting started

The first thing to do was to create a new branch to begin work.

```bash
  git checkout -b hw3
  mkdir HW3
  cd HW3
  touch index.md
```

Next, the Java code was downloaded, compiled and then tested.
