# Welcome To My Portfolio
This is a collection of my attempt to code.


## About Me

I am a Computer Science major at [Western Oregon University](http://www.wou.edu/). I have some general IT experience, three years as a Cyber Network Operator ([MOS 0651](http://mosmanual.com/pages/mos/06/0651.php)) in the United States Marine Corps. Unfortunately most of this experience doesn't translate to coding.

## Code Storage
I have repositories here: [GitHub](https://github.com/avisuano/CS460) and here: [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/avisuano15/cs460/src/master/). The later is mostly a back up for now, but will be transitioned into the main storage after CS460.
