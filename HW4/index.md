# Homework Four

The requirements for this assignment can be found [here](http://www.wou.edu/~morses/classes/cs46x/assignments/HW4_1819.html).

The repository of code can be found [here](https://github.com/avisuano/CS460/tree/master/HW4).

First things first. I created an empty project in Visual Studio, and pushed that to the repository. After that, a new branch was created and work began on Homework Four.

```git
git checkout -b hw4_main
```
After some initial work on the desktop, I decided to hone my Git skills and move to my laptop.

```git
git fetch origin hw4_main
git pull origin hw4_main
git checkout hw4_main
```

Fortunately everything appeared to work correctly and I then began working on the Mile to Metric Converter part of the assignment.
