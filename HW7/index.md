The problems that ended homework six followed me to homework seven. After another round of intense Googling, it turned out to be a simple fix. Just needed to clear out some files that most likely got corrupted when the drama was underway with homework six. When everything was working correctly, a new branch ```git checkout -b hw7_main``` was created, and work began.
